# Animal-classification-with-a-CNN
This is a model classifing images into classes of dogs, horses, elephants, butterflies and squirrels
Convolutional neural networks are widely used in image classification problems and serve as an important stepping stone into graph NN and more complicated architectures.

Note some of the following:

-The number of layers and hyperparemeters, as well as for exmaple using SGD instead of Adam is arbitrary and most definitely not optimal
-If we wanted to get the best possible performance we would split the train data set further to get a validation set and implement early stopping.
-When running the code obviously need to change path
